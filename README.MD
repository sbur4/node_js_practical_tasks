# Practical task

## Prerequisites

You are working for a delivery company that has offices in Great Britain, Germany, France and the Netherlands. You are a part of backend team that focuses on building internal tools for that company. One day you received a new request from a customer to create a public holidays module. This module will:

- show a list of public holidays for specific country for the current year
- show the next public holiday for specific country
- show if today is public holiday in your location

After some time of investigation, you found ``Nager.Date API`` that meets the requirements above. Your customer agreed to use it, so now you can start the development.

Once youâ€™ve finished writing code, you have to cover your module with tests.

## Source code

You can find the implementation ``here``.

## Task 1

Write unit tests for ``public-holidays.service.ts`` and ``helpers.ts`` files. Keep in mind that any external calls are mocked in unit tests.

## Task 2

Write integration tests for ``public-holidays.service.ts``. Do not forget that in this case you make real calls to the API.

## Task 3

Get code coverage with tests for your application. Strive to have no less than 90% of code coverage.

## Task 4

Select any 2 endpoints from ``Nager.Date API`` and write e2e tests for them.
